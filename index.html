  <h4> International Women's Day<h4>

  Happy international women’s day!  The love I have for the women in my life is strong and I want to take today to celebrate this.  I am so grateful for my mother and sisters, for female friendship and for the incredible female changemakers with whom I work at Dalberg Global Development Advisors.  

A quick note on each: 
<p>
1.	Family:  My mother is a 58 year old who wakes up every morning and runs.  It doesn’t matter the weather, the conditions, or the time; she gets up and she runs.  Not only does she run, but she’s always fighting to get better -- and I love that.  It inspires me to hustle and bring my full energy and commitment to everything I do.  No matter how each day ends, my mom wakes up tries to do better in her run the next day.  (Of course, her fierce attitude extends far beyond the realm of running.) 
<p>
2.	Female friendship:  I count myself so lucky to have some of the most loving, yet honest and self-aware female friends.  Some friends have known me through all my hair cycles: buzz cut, to blonde highlights and back to my current natural phase; others have only seen one or two.  These friendships are not without complications, but that is what makes them so great.  They are real; they endure.  And most of all, these women inspire me to make the world a better place and hold me accountable to be my full self. 
<p>
3.	Dalberg:  Imagine a platform with three businesses, all led by women. (The Dalberg Platform.)  Or, imagine a consulting firm with two of four regions led by women. (Dalberg Global Development Advisors).    Just having passed my one year work anniversary at Dalberg, I am proud to work at firm that espouses a culture of equity and empowerment for both women and men – all of whom are seeking to create positive impact in the world.
