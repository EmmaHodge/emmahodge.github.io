<h3> Geneva: Lunch by the lake </h3>

  The novelty of being a new place is always one that I have found to be energizing.  I was particularly inspired by the geography of Geneva today.  I had lunch sitting by the lake, looking out towards the Alps and at Mont Blanc.  I can't wait to jump in that clear blue water when it gets a bit warmer.

  Happy international women’s day!  The love that I have for the women in my life is strong and something that I want to celebrate today.  I am so grateful for my mother and sisters, for female friendship and for the incredible female changemakers with whom I work at Dalberg Global Development Advisors.  

A quick note on each: 
<p>
1.	Family:  My mother is 58 years old and wakes up every morning to run.  It doesn’t matter the weather, the conditions, or the time; she simply gets up and she runs.  Not only does she run, but she’s always fighting to get better -- and I love that.  It inspires me to hustle and bring my full energy and commitment to everything I do.  No matter how each day ends, my mom wakes up tries to do better in her run the next day.  (Of course, her fierce attitude extends far beyond the realm of running.) 
<p>
2.	Female friendship:  I have some of the most loving, honest and self-aware female friends.  Some have experienced my full hair cycle with me: buzz cut, to blonde highlights and back to my current natural phase; others have only seen one or two stages.  These friendships are not without complications, but that is what makes them so great.  They are real; they endure.  And most of all, these women hold me accountable to be my full self. 
<p>
3.	Dalberg:  Imagine a platform with three businesses, all led by women. (The Dalberg Platform.)  Or, imagine a consulting firm with two of four regions led by women. (Dalberg Global Development Advisors.)    Just having passed my one year work anniversary at Dalberg, I am proud to work at firm that espouses a culture of equity and empowerment for both women and men – all of whom are seeking to create positive impact in the world.
